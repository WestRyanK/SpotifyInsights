# Spotify Insights
Each year, Spotify Wrapped shows its users some nice graphics that summarizes that year's listening habits. I always find myself wanting a more in-depth analysis than what Wrapped offers. Spotify Insights allows me to see those stats I've always wanted to see. It's not as pretty as Wrapped, but it gets the data I'm interested in.
